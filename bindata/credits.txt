Compliance:

It is assumed that this text being reasonably accessible to the user within the program is sufficient to count as being "provided with the distribution".

CCUpdaterUI will try to store the location you specify.
This is to prevent repetition.
If you activate Developer Mode, CCUpdaterUI will store this.
CCUpdaterUI may, when asked to install a package, install other packages necessary for that package to operate.
It is assumed that asking to install the package grants permission to do this to prevent failures.

This situation is a tad complicated.
Officially, according to the license, the following block appears to suffice:

    Portions of this software are copyright Â© 2010 The FreeType
    Project (www.freetype.org).  All rights reserved.

However, it's reasonable to assume that in the conversion to Go some original work was performed.
As such, it should be acknowledged that not only is it the work of the FreeType authors but also those working on golang/freetype.
